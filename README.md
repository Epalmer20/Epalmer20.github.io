### Impeachment Analysis

In October 2020, we used raw data of House Democrats’ positions regarding President Trump’s impeachment to find potential stories. 

Results can be found [here](https://Epalmer20.github.io/impeachmentanalysis/Impeachmentanalysis.html)

### Biden Transition Analysis 

After Joe Biden's 2020 election, there were new appointments to the White House and agencies. For this class we scraped data from [website](https://buildbackbetter.gov/nominees-and-appointees/) using R to analyze the new appointees under Biden. 

Results can be found [here](https://Epalmer20.github.io/bidentransition/index.html).

### Biden Transition Tracker

We recently used Flex Dashboard to produce an interactive analysis of the Biden Transition data. You can see the White House Senior Staff and Agency Review Team members listed in searchable and filterable charts.

Results can be found [here]()
