## Welcome to GitHub Pages

### About me

I am a fourth-year student at The George Washington University graduating in December 2020 with a BA in Communication and minors in Sustainability and Journalism. I am looking to pair my academic interests in media relations with advocacy for global sustainability.

### Impeachment Analysis

In October 2020, we used raw data of House Democrats’ positions regarding President Trump’s impeachment to find potential stories. 

Results can be found [here](https://Epalmer20.github.io/impeachmentanalysis/Impeachmentanalysis.html)

### Biden Transition Analysis 

After Joe Biden's 2020 election, there were new appointments to the White House and agencies. For this class we scraped data from [website](https://buildbackbetter.gov/nominees-and-appointees/) using R to analyze the new appointees under Biden. 

Results can be found [here](https://Epalmer20.github.io/bidentransition/index.html).

### Biden transition tracker

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Epalmer20/Epalmer20.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Epalmer20/Epalmer20.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
